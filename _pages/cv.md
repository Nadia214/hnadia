 **Thesis Title:Medical Image Analysis System to Detect Skin Diseases Based on Texture Features Using Image Processing Technology and Machine Learning," focuses on designing an automated system to detect four skin diseases: Seborrheic Dermatitis, Melanoma, Impetigo, and Diabetic Foot Ulcer**

* A comparative analysis of segmentation techniques (Marker-Controlled Watershed Algorithm, K-means Clustering, and Otsu Thresholding) and feature extraction methods
* The system employed image processing techniques for pre-processing and segmentation, extracting texture features using Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Image Quality Assessment (IQA).
*  Classified the diseases using Linear Support Vector Machine (L-SVM), Non-Linear Support Vector Machine (NL-SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.
