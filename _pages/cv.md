Research Experience
======
 **Thesis Title:Medical Image Analysis System to Detect Skin Diseases Based on Texture Features Using Image Processing Technology and Machine Learning," focuses on designing an automated system to detect four skin diseases: Seborrheic Dermatitis, Melanoma, Impetigo, and Diabetic Foot Ulcer**

*The primary aim of this research is to develop a robust medical image analysis system to detect four skin diseases — Seborrheic Dermatitis, Melanoma, Impetigo, and Diabetic Foot Ulcer — by leveraging texture features extracted using advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.
*  A comparative analysis of segmentation techniques (Marker-Controlled Watershed Algorithm, K-means Clustering, and Otsu Thresholding) and feature extraction methods.The system employed image processing techniques for pre-processing and segmentation, extracting texture features using Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Image Quality Assessment (IQA).Classified the diseases using Linear Support Vector Machine (L-SVM), Non-Linear Support Vector Machine (NL-SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms andResults show competitive accuracy for segmentation and classification methods, with the highest accuracy reaching 95% for some classifiers.
*  This research stands out for its innovative, cost-effective approach to accurately detect multiple skin diseases using advanced image processing, comparative techniques, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.
