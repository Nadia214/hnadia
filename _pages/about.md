Hereâ€™s a polished version of your text with enhanced flow and professional tone:

Welcome to My Corner of the Web!

Iâ€™m Nadia Hossain, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology (AUST). My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, and Medical Image Processing.

I am deeply committed to developing innovative, cost-effective solutions for low-resource natural languages, ensuring that marginalized voices are amplified and represented.

Currently, I am preparing to embark on an exciting journey as I look forward to pursuing a Ph.D. in Fall 2025.

I also enjoy fostering curiosity and inspiring the next generation of tech leaders by sharing insights and sparking meaningful discussions in the field.

Thank you for visiting my digital space! Feel free to connect with me at nadiahossain214@gmail.com.
